            Hi Baby, we meet again on the same site but this time it's kinda new, 
            you know i made this site on this same day just for you and your happiness.
            I hope you enjoy all the gifts here.
            <br>
            So i wanted to say some things about our relationship.
            You know, i wrote this on the older version of this site:

            <br>
            You see i wrote 1+ year relationship and that turned in to a 2+ years relationship baby.
            This last year we had some arguments and bad things may happened but all of that shit went away and we 
            stayed happy and smiling, frogot those poops and went ahead to live our happy lives.
            <br>
            By the time we met we were young, confused, lost but we knew one thing that we are together and we will find ourselves with
            the help of time and we did, now we know who we are why are we here and who we love.
            <br>
            And the one and only thing i will remember the most. is who i love, that is the person who is celebrating their birthay today, 
            my little girlfriend, princess, wifey, baby and metalka.
            <br>
            HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY BABYYYYY🎈🎉🎂❤💕
