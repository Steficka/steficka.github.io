                15.9.2006, the day you were born - your birthday, also the day the best person i know was born in this world.<br>
                Maybe you didn't expect yourself to have a boyfriend like me, and you didn't expect to ever have a 1+ year relationship,<br>
                but you do. :) This isn't the second birthday you'll celebrate with me, because the years will count on as we still stand together
                one near another, living our life together, cooking together, waking up together, counting the days left untill <br>
                our birthdays and anniversaries. When i am near you, i feel so amazed by your beauty, but it doesen't end here i also feel<br>
                safe, happy, exited like a little child that can't wait to recive his gift, but the difference is that i recived you and i don't<br>
                need anything else (expect water and air, <span id="sf">ama ke se snajdam &#129315;</span>).

                Maybe sometimes we have arguments, but we deal with them in less than 0.0001 sec.&#129315;<br>
                Sometimes there are tough, and hard to deal with times but, with eachothers help, love and support and a little bit of time everything goes back to normal and
                we continue our life as if nothing happend. Sometimes we have so many things that bother us, or things that we don't really
                want or we have so many things to care about even on our age, but today is your day baby and you don't have to care about anything,
                forget everything and everyone that bothers you and think about your birthday and your loved once, so have a HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY LITTLE QUEEN &#127874; &#127874; &#127880; &#127880; &#10084; &#10084;
